If you take a step back and look at your life, you have been doing two things most of the time : _Making sense of the world_ and _doing something adding value_. But how does one make sense of the world and what kind of life skills one needs to acquire to do the same effectively. I have outlined the most important skills to make sense of the world around us and also the most important skill to be able to then execute on the understanding. Also, though the skills here would be suitable for any age group and any environment, any examples used in this are in context of a typical modern workplace. Given these skills, a modern worker can effectively be productive in his workplace.

#### The meat! 

* Be Curious - About everything around. Curiosity gives birth to innovation.
* Be empathetic - Know people better. Get the social power in your hands
* Be Gritty - and take the task to the finish line.

#### Curiosity - Back to being a kid

Curiosity is a gift to human kind and this is one single reason why homo-sapiens are human beings today (and not just another [phyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum)). Needless to say that curiosity has enabled us to look not just outside but also with in ourselves. 

The problem is that with time, we become less and less curious and this lack of curiosity to understand and explore leads us to become unhappy. If there is one thing that can bring us back to being a child again, that is curiosity.

Curiosity is a single important factor to give birth to innovation. An incurious person will be the typical office worker who is getting minimum things done to keep his job. A workplace where people are not curious can never foster innovation. On a side note, I genuinely believe that curiosity is something that the companies need to measure to understand how innovative they are and could be. While writing this, I am trying to think if there can be a curiosity meter to serve as a leading indicator for the quality of innovation possible at a company. Lets park this curiosity meter for some other time. 

While being curious is a good thing in general, there is one anti patten that I'd like to mention. I like to call this **A case of curious monkeys**. Curious monkeys jump from one topic to another and they never stay curious about anything for a decent depth. This leads to shallow knowledge, lack of focus and ultimately loss of productivity and eventually lack of happiness.

#### Empathy - I trust you

While curiosity can of course spark the interest to know the why about things around us, the world around us is made of people and we are social beings. We are talking about normal workplaces here where people needs people to work and get stuff done. While people are getting things done, people go through shit and people behave randomly while navigating their way through the shit. To ensure sanity of our mind and delivery of our work, we need to understand what the other people are going through.

##### Step 1 : People are sincere

To be able to understand and empathize with other person's problem, we need to start with one basic rule. _People are normally sincere_. It's easier to assume that the other person would be going through tougher times with the previous assumption. Please note that I am not suggesting you to trust whatever shit is being explained. I am only suggesting you to at least consider a possibility of a more deeper trouble than what looks on the surface.

##### Step 2 : Problems minus Emotions equals data

Once you have started listening, it's easier. But let's not forget the importance of data here. Its been said again and again - **In God we trust. All others must bring data.** The objective here is to remove the emotion and get all the underlying data about the problem while being empathetic at all times.

#### Grit - Be the tortoise

Ability to execute and take any task to a logical conclusion as required by all stakeholders is a fundamental requirement of being a modern workplace :) A person may not be curious and may not be empathetic and he can still be gritty. The problem is that these kind of people become the regular replaceable delivery men of the world. The grit of a person really shines out when he is trying to deliver the real value by innovating on the smallest spoke of the wheel he is part of.

It's a long life. Take a stroll and It's always good to be tortoise.
